        DSG recently elevated its environmental commitment through 
        solar plants that support 50 percent of the company’s 
        electricity requirements for production units — the maximum 
        allowed by the government. This measure of the company makes 
        use of the natural and abundantly available renewable source 
        of energy – Solar Energy, thereby reducing it’s carbon footprint. 
        The other half of the energy produced by the company is provided 
        at a very nominal fee to the community through the Administrative channels.<br><br>Beliefs are the bedrock of any brand — and INFINI’s are strong.
